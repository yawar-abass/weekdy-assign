## Other Details

I have deployed it on vercel. Here is the live url: [Live Url](https://weekdy-assign.vercel.app/)

I have separated the logic for fetching data with infinite scroll and filtering logic in the hooks folder.

The utils folder contains utility functions related to fetching data and filters.

I have used some dummy data for some filters and fetched data from the API for others.
